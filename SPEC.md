## 1) Purpose
Primary goal: Filter for people who are likely to be good clients, and get them to actually contact me.

Present me as a smart, attractive, quirky woman who is appealing to rich, kind, generous, intellectually alive, agentic men. I want to seem approachable and unique. Personable but also high status. 

## 2) Audience
- People who find me via: Tryst, twitter.

## 3) Success Criteria
- Loads fast, feels “clean + intentional + artsy”.
- Works perfectly on mobile.
- Easy to update without breaking styles.
- Every change is small, reviewable, revertible (Git guardrails).

## 4) Pages (MVP)
Reference websites: https://adahopper.com/ http://abigail.glass/ https://noviefox.com/ https://www.oliveoren.vip/ https://taliasable.com/

My website shouldn't be substantially different in terms of layout or flow from these examples. It should be artfully interwoven with high-quality pictures that match the color schema and seemlessly work on mobile or on laptop browser. 

Sections in order:
1. Hero

### Rates
Rather than just listing the rates, add a short story about what can be done in that time, more like Ada Hopper's site. 
1 hour: 3000
2 hours: 3800
3 hours: 4400
4 hours: 5000

### Dates Game
I want a gammified approach, with lists that have points. Like 2 michelin stars = 2 points, flying to a new country = 10 points. And points = something, like get the next rate tier down for something (24 points = 24 hrs = 16 hour cost)

### Ettiquette 
Make this more personable and less serious. Cut down on unnecessary stuff. Ask for gifts somewhere. 

Envelopes
In a book

An Introduction
When we talk about who we are, what we choose to say is revealing. It's never the whole picture. Here I do my best to feed you enough morsels of myself for you to decide:

Walk away or come closer?

I'm a nerd, a hippie, a writer, an ex-programmer, a businesswoman. I chase growth and unusual experiences. I have social anxiety and a burning desire to connect.

This is my vague outline, the shadow on the wall. I look forward to revealing myself more fully.

Stats
Ethnicity: Eurasian
Height: 5'1"
Bust: 32C
Waist: 27"
Weight: 105lbs
Hips: 37"
Shoe size: 37IT
‍
Countries visited: 24
Myers-Briggs: INTJ
Enneagram: 4w3

The Sides of the Dice
Facets of myself I bring to the table

Empath: Compassion in presence
I dive into the emotional deep end. Things can get weird down there, but it's cozy to cuddle and share intimately. I'm not afraid of intense or difficult emotions.

Massages and oxytocin. Silent eye contact. Authentic relating.

Diogenes: Playfulness in intellect
To put it gently, I'm a huge nerd. Let's investigate ideas with curiosity and goodnatured irreverence.

AI. Supply chains. DnD. How brains work. Ethics. Consciousness. Narratives and frames.

Sensate: Bliss of the moment
I'm "energetically sensitive," whatever that means. Small sensations—the electricity of a small touch—reach deep into my core.
‍
Slow dances. Beauty in the mundane. Divine comedy. Plein air watercoloring.

Adventurer: Delight in the novel
Ooh, novelty. The fear? That makes the growth more delicious. There's something very intimate about trying something for the first time with someone.

Challenges and becoming stronger. Climbing, BJJ, hitchhiking.

2 hours: 3800

Extended retreats:
Overnight, 16 hours: 12000
A turn of the Earth, 24 hours: 17000
Complete weekend, 60 hours: 32000
Vacation, 5 days: 55000

Notes: 
• If we haven't met before, a paid video call is required before an extended retreat
• FMTY dates are an overnight minimum
• In-date extensions are 1500/hour

The Fine Print
I require a deposit for all appointments, and a 50% deposit for visits longer than 4 hours. Deposits are non-refundable, and are payable in giftcards, paypal, or cryptocurrency.

When we meet, place the rest of the donation in an unmarked envelope or book and leave it visible in the room, or discreetly hand it to me if we are in public.

If you have symptoms of any illness, let me know as soon as you can so we can reschedule.



Cancellations
If you need to reschedule, please let me know >48 hours before our meeting. Within 48 hours, I require a cancellation fee of 50% of total booking. Within 24 hours I ask for 100%. Half can be used toward a rescheduled meet within 4 weeks.

Screening
I require either real world information (your full name, phone number, and employment details) or two excellent provider references from within the past year. This information will be kept private, secure, and will be shared with no one.

Respect
I don’t do anything illegal or unsafe, and I always reserve the right to say 'no' if I’m not enjoying myself. The good news is, if I do something with you, you know it’s because I want to. If the chemistry is right, we can go all kinds of places.

Authenticity
I am best at playing myself. If you have a fantasy that requires me to play a part that isn't true to me, sadly, I cannot. However, I've found roleplay to be a powerful and fun way to creatively free different parts of ourselves. Keep in mind that roleplay is a co-creation that requires the interest of all parties.

I'm an unusual person. While I can pretend to be ordinary long enough to order a coffee, I'd rather be myself. Don't worry, I will always strive to be respectful and act appropriately to the context.

Dates
I'm an ambivert: A cozy night in is as good as a night out having an adventure. But if it comes to adventures..
• I like starting at a chill bar with sour cocktails or by grabbing some Vietnamese, Japanese, or Italian
• Great food makes me emotional. In SF I'd like to eat at Lazy bear, Quince, or Atelier Crenn. In NYC, Jungsik, Le Coucou, Carbone
• Bucket list: milk a cow, ride an overnight train, join the mile high club in a PJ, go to a strip club, see a runway show, and play in the city museum in St. Louis
• Shopping dates: Issey Miyake, Cult Gaia, Miu Miu, L'Agence, Bottega Veneta
• Traveling: Bali, Mexico City, Japan, Iceland for hot springs, and Norway for fjords and auroras
